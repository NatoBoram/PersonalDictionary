## Guidelines

These dictionaries are for the personal use of @NatoBoram, and as such, have a few guidelines that you might not agree with. Use at your own discretion.

1. Proper names are in their original language and stored under "All languages".
2. The whole world wasn't copied to these dictionaries, only what's relevant to me.

## Format

Gboard dictionaries are [Tab-separated values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) with one word per line. Lines starting with `#` are ignored.
